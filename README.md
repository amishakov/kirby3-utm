### Tracking

Events will automatically be tracked to a sqlite database and appear in the UTM page within the panel grouped by campaign and displaying multiple stats.

## UTM

Original UTM explanation from [Bonnie Kittle at cdgi.com](https://www.cdgi.com/2020/04/how-to-use-utm-codes-to-track-campaigns-in-google-analytics/).

### utm_source

The advertiser, site, publication, etc. that is sending traffic to your property

### utm_medium

The advertising or marketing medium, for example, CPC (cost-per-click), banner ad, email newsletter

### utm_campaign

The individual campaign name, slogan, promo code, etc.

### utm_term

Identify paid search keywords. If youâ€™re manually tagging paid keyword campaigns, you should also use utm_term to specify the keyword.

### utm_content

Used to differentiate similar content or links within the same ad. For example, if you have two call-to-action links within the same email message, you can use utm_content and set different values for each so you can tell which version is more effective. (i.e. image, button, headline)
